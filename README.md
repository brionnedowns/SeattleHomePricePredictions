# Seattle Home Price Predictions

Witlark Realty & Co aims to assist residents with preparing to sell their homes by determining the optimal sales price to enter the market. Our goal is to maximize client proceeds (and thus company commissions) while expediting the time to confirmed sales. Todayâ€™s analysis focuses on the Seattle market. Our deliverable will be a regression model and analysis of the key factors that correlate with higher home pricing. This will help us improve our ability to forecast the appropriate pricing for a home.




The dataset utilized in this analysis (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)) contains the prices of homes sold in King County, Washington between May 2014 and May 2015.
